Summer '24 Project Repository
Welcome to my Summer '24 project repository! This project aims to implement a machine learning algorithm in Python to enable a desktop plug-in camera to recognize me and others.

Features:
Face Detection: Leverages traditional computer vision techniques to detect faces in real-time using Haar Cascades.
Face Recognition: Identifies and distinguishes between different individuals using the camera by training a Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH) model.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple setup and easy-to-use interface for seamless integration with your desktop.
Technologies Used:
Python: The core language for implementing the machine learning algorithm.
OpenCV: For image processing, face detection, and face recognition tasks using LBPH.
NexiGO N60 FHD Webcam: The camera used for real-time face detection and recognition.
